&emsp;This site itself! When designing a portfolio website, I wanted an approach that
would demonstrate my relevant skillset but also show off how much I value
functional, minimal, and quality software. 

&emsp;I chose to combine my existing
knowledge of the popular framework Vue but also explore the potential
performance gains that come with minimizing JavaScript sent to the client,
using the new Astro framework.
