&emsp;This site itself! When designing a portfolio website, I wanted an
approach that would demonstrate my relevant skillset but also show off how much
I value functional, minimal, and quality software. 

&emsp;I chose to combine my existing knowledge of the popular framework Vue but
also explore the potential performance gains that come with minimizing
JavaScript sent to the client, using the new Astro framework.

&emsp;This site is self hosted on one of my spare debian 11 machines. I set up
using docker-compose and an nginx reverse proxy.
