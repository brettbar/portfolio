## Where I've called home
- Currently living in beautiful North Idaho, (Couer d'alene).
- I've lived all over the PNW (Oregon, Western & Eastern WA, North and South Idaho).
- Have a ton of family in Idaho and Eastern WA, and plan on staying for the forseeable future.

## Whats important to me
- My Roman Catholic faith.
- My family and beautiful fiance Margaret.
- My Basque/Spanish heritage.
- History, Theology, and Philosophy.

## What I value in software
- The less code to solve a problem the better, simple solutions are better than complex ones.
- Performance isn't an afterthought, computer hardware is amazing yet most software runs
orders of magnitudes slower and worse than it should.
- Software bloat is a pervasive issue, the 'hundreds-of-megabytes-node_module'
  anti-pattern must end.
- In most cases as a programmer, you should be using the terminal/CLI to
  interface with your computer. While IDEs can have there place, I will always
  prefer Vim (with plugins) and the terminal for 90% of projects.
- Privacy-respecting Free and Open-source Software (FOSS), GNU/Linux all day everyday.
