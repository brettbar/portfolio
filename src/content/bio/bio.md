title: 'Who I am'
---

## Where I've called home
- I've always called the PNW my home
- Born in Corvallis OR, lived in Salem OR and Vancouver WA as a kid
- Moved to Snohomish (Greater Seattle Area) WA in middle school
- Headed to Spokane WA for college at Gonzaga University, and then Northern Idaho afterwards
- Have a ton of family in Idaho and Eastern WA, and plan on staying for the forseeable future

## What I value
- My Roman Catholic faith
- My family and beautiful fiance Margaret
- My Basque/Spanish heritage
- History, Theology, and Philosophy

## What I value (in software)
- The less code to solve a problem the better, simple solutions are better than complex ones
- Performance isn't an afterthought, computer hardware is amazing and most software runs
orders of magnitudes slower and worse than it should
- Software bloat is a pervasive issue, the 'hundreds-of-megabytes-node_module' anti-pattern must end
- In most cases as a programmer, you should be using the terminal/CLI to interface with your computer. While IDEs can have there place, I will always prefer Vim (with plugins) and the terminal for 90% of projects
- Privacy-respecting Free and Open-source Software (FOSS), GNU/Linux all day everyday

## Who I look up to 
- Christ 
- My Parents 
- My Grandparents
- My soulmate Margaret

## Who I look up to (in tech)
- Jonathan Blow

- Lifting (still got a long way to go on that one)
