# My Portfolio Website

- When designing a portfolio website, I wanted an approach that would
  demonstrate my relevant skillset but also show off how much I value
  functional, minimal, and quality software.

- I chose to combine my existing knowledge of the popular framework Vue but
  also explore the potential performance gains that come with minimizing
  JavaScript sent to the client, using the new Astro framework.
